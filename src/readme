*** README for pilotage - 06/02/06 ***

[For details on installing pilotage see the INSTALL file]

This is the README for pilotage, a flight simulator of montgolfier. In the future other 
vehicles would be supported and maybe it will be ported on the Linux platform (now the library we use (jPCT) only work under Windows).

It's a student project.


Have fun.
