        This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
        contributed to pilotage. The format is the same as in
        /usr/src/linux/CREDITS. It is sorted by name and formatted to
        allow easy grepping and beautification by scripts.  The fields
        are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W), PGP key ID and
        fingerprint (P), description (D), and snail-mail address (S).
        Thanks,
			Loïc (stolen from Linus)
